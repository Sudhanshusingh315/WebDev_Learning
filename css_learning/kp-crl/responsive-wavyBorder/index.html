            <p>
                Cats are fascinating in how they communicate. From the soft purring when theyâ€™re content to their playful meows when they're seeking attention, each sound has a purpose. Cats also show affection with gentle head bumps, and their tail movements are full of meaning. Understanding their signals makes bonding with them even more special.
